# circolor
A simple HTML5 game built for testing out the Phaser framework

Playable at: https://hamptus.github.io/circolor/

## About
I built this to test out the Phaser framework. Even though there are some svg files in the repository, I ended up not using any image files. All graphics are generated with the PIXI library. This project is no longer being actively developed.

## Goal
Fill each target with color before running out of lives. Balls can't shoot through filled targets, so be careful when you aim.

## Controls
The game is playable using the mouse, keyboard, or touch controls.

### Mouse
Drag the mouse in the direction you want the ball to move. The ball will fire at the target when you release the left click.

### Keyboard
Use the arrow keys to move left or right. Press the spacebar to fire the ball.

### Touch
Drag your finger left or right to move the ball. Lift your finger off the screen to fire the ball.
